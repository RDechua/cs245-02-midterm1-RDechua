Give Theta running time as a function of n for the method shown below and
provide an explanation to get full credit.
This is a non-coding question, no need to write or run code.

public static int func(int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
       for (int j = 1; j <= n; j = j + 2) {
          for (int k = n; k >= 1; k--) {
                sum  = sum + i + j*k;
          } // end of k loop
        } // end of j loop
    } // end of i loop

    // Note that l goes to n*n
    for (int l = 1; l <= n*n; l++) {
        sum++;
    }
    return sum;
}
Your answer:
(a) Answer (0.5 pt)

(b) Explanation (1.5 pt):
Make sure you explain the running time of each loop and explain how to combine them.
