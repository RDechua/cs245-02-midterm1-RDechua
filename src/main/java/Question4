Consider the following recursive function that computes the factorial of n:

public static int factorial(int n) {
        if (n < 0)
           throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        if (n ==0 || n == 1)
           return 1;
        int res = factorial(n-1);
        return n * res;
}
(a) (1pt) Give a recurrence relation for this function (give both base and recursive cases).


(b) (1pt) Solve the recurrence relation using either repeated substitution
or recursion tree to get Theta of the running time.
