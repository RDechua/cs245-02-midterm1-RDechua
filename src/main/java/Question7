Solve the following recurrence relation using the Master method.
T(0) = T(1) = C1
T(n) = 16T(n/4) + n^(1.5)

Explain your answer. What are the two functions you are comparing?
Specify which case applies; if applying case 1 or 3, give epsilon; in case 3, also give C.

Please refer to the description of this question on Canvas
where the instructor listed three cases of the Master theorem.
